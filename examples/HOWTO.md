# How to use the API
This document would typically be a README.md in your repository, but since we used the README.md file to explain the three different API implementations, we are going to use this file as example documentation for each API.

## Basic Flask API

### Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to install the dependencies.  You can do this by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the API
To run the API, you can run the following command:
```bash
python basic-flask.py
```

### Using the API
Once the API is running, you can use the following commands to interact with it.

#### Customers

The customers endpoint is used to get information about customers.  There are two paths that can be used to get information about customers.  The first is to get all of the customers.  The second is to get a specific customer by id.
An example of the customer object is:
```json
    {
        "FirstName": "John",
        "LastName": "Doe",
        "Company": "Acme, Inc.",
        "Address": "123 Main St.",
        "City": "Anytown",
        "State": "CA",
        "Country": "USA",
        "PostalCode": "12345",
        "Phone": "555-555-5555",
        "Fax": "555-555-5555",
        "Email": ""
    }  
```
With the application running in a terminal, you'll need to connect to the application using an endpoint such as web browser or Postman.  The following endpoints are available:

* http://localhost:5000/customers - GET - Returns a list of all customers
* http://localhost:5000/customers/{id} - GET - Returns a single customer by id
* http://localhost:5000/customers - POST - Creates a new customer
* http://localhost:5000/customers/{id} - DELETE - Deletes a customer by id
* http://localhost:5000/customers - PUT - Updates a customer

## Advanced Flask API

### Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to install the dependencies.  You can do this by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the API
To run the API, you can run the following command:
```bash
python advanced-flask.py
```

### Using the API
Once the API is running, you can use the following commands to interact with it.

#### Customers
The customers endpoint is used to get information about customers.  There is only one path in the Advanced Flask API that can be used to get information about customers.  The path is to get all of the customers.  The path is:

https://localhost:5000/customers

but there are two optional parameters which can be used to filter the results.  The parameters are:
start - The starting index of the results (default = 0 if not specified)
limit - The number of results to return (default = 10 if not specified)

So that means that the following paths are also valid:
* https://localhost:5000/customers?start=0&limit=10
* https://localhost:5000/customers?start=10&limit=10
* https://localhost:5000/customers?limit=10

#### Invoices
The invoices endpoint is used to get information about invoices.  There is only one path in the Advanced Flask API that can be used to get information about invoices.  The path is to get all of the invoices.  The path is:

https://localhost:5000/invoices

but there are two optional parameters which can be used to filter the results.  The parameters are:
start - The starting index of the results (default = 0 if not specified)
limit - The number of results to return (default = 10 if not specified)

So that means that the following paths are also valid:
* https://localhost:5000/invoices?start=0&limit=10
* https://localhost:5000/invoices?start=10&limit=10
* https://localhost:5000/invoices?limit=10

The result of an invoices request looks like:
```json
[
    {
        "customerId": 2,
        "invoiceDate": "2009-01-01 00:00:00",
        "invoiceId": 1,
        "invoiceItems": [
            {
                "invoiceLineId": 1,
                "quantity": 1,
                "trackId": 2,
                "unitPrice": 0.99
            },
            {
                "invoiceLineId": 2,
                "quantity": 1,
                "trackId": 4,
                "unitPrice": 0.99
            }
        ]
    },
]
```
