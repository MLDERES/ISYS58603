# Group Assignment 6 - Using Another API

## Goal
The goal of this assignment is to help students to see how decisions made in their work affect the usability of their API.  In other words, how easy is it to use your API?  We're going to do this by having you use another group's API.  You will need to use the API that another group has created and then create a front-end application that uses that API.  You will demonstrate how your front-end leverages the API.

## Deliverable
Submit the GitHub URL of your repository containing all code, dependencies, and a README with instructions for running the application. The application will be evaluated based on the effective use of the API, correctness, completeness (utilization of various API endpoints), and creativity.  *You don't need to call all the endpoints available, but you should use several so that you have a fully functioning application*

***<span style="color:red">NOTE:</span>This should be a new repository than the one you have been using up until now.  You can clone/fork the other team's repository locally so that you can run the API - but your front-end should be in a completely new repository with only your code.***

Be prepared to share your new creation.  Depending on the semester, this may be a video or it may be a live presentation.


## Background
The goal here is simply to use the API.  There is no need for something fancy, but we want you to create something new with the API. Don't simply copy the implementation that was given to you, come up with a new creation.

## Help and Hints
It may be helpful to start by exercising a few of the endpoints via [postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) or [curl](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html).  This will help you to understand how the API works and what data it returns.  Once you have a good understanding of the API, you can start to build your front-end.
